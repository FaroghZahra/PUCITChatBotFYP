## Batched Gradient Descent:
Batched Gradient Descent is implemented using numpy. The working of BGD is explained step by step using toy dataset and then the implementation is done on real world dataset.
### Packages Required:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib

Data Sets are attached, along with the Jupyter Notebook.
The Dataset "Book1.csv" is the dataset of toy example while "GPA.csv" is the real dataset. Two different datasets are used because for BGD to give good results dataset should include atleast 30 datapoints.
