## MACHINE LEARNING
The following topics are studied and implemented under the domain of Machine Learning.
<br>

### 1. Regression through OLS:
Linear and Mulitlinear Regression implemented using Sklearn's Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) Model

### 2. Regression through Gradient Descent:
Linear and Mulitlinear Regression implemented using Gradient Descent Algorithm

### 3. Batched Gradient Descent:
Batched Gradient Descent is implemented using numpy. The working of BGD is explained step by step using toy dataset and then the implementation is done on real world dataset.

### 4. Stochastic Gradient Descent:
SGD takes a random instance of the training data at each step and computes the gradient. This makes it much faster than BGD as it processes much less data at a time.

### 5. Topic Modelling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation:
Topic Modelling model implemented using Sklearn's Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

### 6. Spam Ham detection:
Detecting email text as Spam or Ham using Naive Bayes.

### 7. Problems of Gradient Descent:
This notebook explains the problems we face while implementing Gradient Descent. These problems include

## DEEP LEARNING
The following topics are studied and implemented under the domain of Deep Learning.
<br>

### 1. Introduction to Deep Learning And Artificial Neural Networks:
An Overview to what deep learning is and why it is needed, and an introduction of topics that are necessary to know about before stepping into the world of deep learning, starting from Artificial Neural Networks.

### 2. Recurrent Neural Networks:
A detailed explanation of what RNNs are, what are it's applications and the vanishing gradient problem which exists in it.

### 3. Long Short-Term Memory
A detailed explanantion of LSTM, how it works and it's implementation.
